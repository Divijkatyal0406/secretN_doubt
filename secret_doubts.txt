1.What all will be encrypted on secret network? Is it only the transactions? How will the query methods will be handled in the secret contract according to secret network standards as query messages are off chain?
2.As the query method has access to only read only storage so should it be encrypted and if yes, How?
3.How to secret contract push information through an open socket connection in response to handle or query msg like normal web services?
4.It is mentioned in the secret docs that avoid using cosmwasm storage such as Singleton, Bucket as it will lead to data leak so what's the solution to that? Will padding work? I implemented space padding to prevent data leak.
